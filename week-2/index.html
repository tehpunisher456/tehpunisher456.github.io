            Hello! My name is Erik Lopez, and I am a new web designer! I am still in the process of learning how to 
            code and am still learning, but I hope to one day make a career out of this. This is my first assignment
            that isn't prework, and this is the first website that I can say I made, even if I don't know how the
            backend works, (thanks Github!).
        <p>
            I honestly don't really do much outside of hanging out with my daughter. She loves watching movies and tv
            shows. She also enjoys looking our fish tank, a 10 gallon reef tank with 2 clownfish, some snails, and an assortment of 
            different coral. She also absolutely loves stuffed animals and has quite a collection from bears to cats 
            and even some pokemon. 
        <p> 
            I'm looking forward to studying towards becoming a web developer!
